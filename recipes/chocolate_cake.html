    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.

        </li>

        <li>
            Pour the batter into two prepared round cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.
        </li>

        <li>
            While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.

        </li>

        <li>
            When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.
        </li>
    </ul>
